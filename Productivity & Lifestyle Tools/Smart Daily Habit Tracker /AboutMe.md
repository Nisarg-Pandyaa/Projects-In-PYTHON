🧠 Smart Daily Habit Tracker – A Friendly Overview<br>
<br>
- This Python program is your personal assistant for building better habits! It’s designed to help you track your daily routines, store your progress, and give you simple yet insightful reports so you can stay consistent and motivated.<br>
<br>
<br>
🌟 What’s the Purpose?<br>
<br>
- We all know how hard it is to stick to good habits—whether it’s working out, drinking enough water, or just reading for a few minutes each day. This habit tracker gives you a quick and easy way to keep track of the habits you're working on, mark them daily, and reflect on how you’ve been doing over the week.<br>
<br>
<br>
🛠️ How It Works (In Simple Words)<br>
<br>
1.) Say Hello & Set Up:<br>

- The program starts by greeting you and asking for your name.<br>

- It then checks if you've used it before. If not, it asks you what habits you want to track (like "Workout", "Drink Water", etc.) and creates a file just for you to save your progress.<br>
<br>
2.) Daily Habit Check-In:<br>

- Each time you run the program, it will ask you if you completed each of your listed habits today.<br>

- Your answers are saved as a simple “yes” or “no” (converted to 1s and 0s) and stored with today’s date in your personal CSV file.<br>
<br>
3.) Track Your Growth:<br>

- Want to see how you’re doing? Just say “yes” when it asks if you’d like to see a report.<br>

- It will read your saved data, calculate how consistently you’ve completed each habit over the week, and show you a clear and colorful bar chart.<br>
<br>
4.) A Friendly Heads-Up:<br>

- If you accidentally added the same habit more than once, the program will give you a warning so you can fix it later.<br>
